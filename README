Created a project folder and copied the test data into it. The "Speech Commands Dataset" is an open sourced dataset consisting of 64,721
WAVE audio files and transcripts of people saying just thirty different common words. Its an archive of nearly 2 GBs. We will divide the
dataset into an 80/10/10 split of train/ cross-validation (dev)/ test sets, and depending on initial output we will change the split, if needed.

Original model:

50 epoch = 18.2%
200 epoch = 19.3%
